# The BESM-6 Unix port: what is left

The work plan. **[README.md](README.md) is the reference** — where the port stands, the design it
settled on, the five hardware rules, the u-area invariant, what a standalone SIMH test costs to get
right, the gotchas, and the consequences deliberately accepted. Read it before starting any task
below; nothing here repeats it.

Each task leaves the tree building (`cd kernel && make`) and the suite passing (`ctest -L kernel`).
Verification is under SIMH via `test/*.ini` — `b6sim` runs a user `a.out` with no kernel underneath
and cannot exercise any of this. `test/mmutest` is the model to copy, and every MMU test runs with
`set mmu cache`; README.md's "Writing a standalone SIMH test" is the rest of that story, including
why `besm6.o` cannot go into one.

**Tasks 1 through 28 are done and their writeups have been removed**; the design they settled on is
README.md, and how each turned out is in the source comments and in [../doc/](../doc/). The
numbering is **left as it was** — task numbers are cited from the sources and from `doc/`.

One task is left. It is small and was deferred deliberately.

| | task | size |
|---|---|---|
| 32 | `profil()`: implement `addupc()` or make it fail | small; the decision is the task |

## 32. `profil()`: implement `addupc()` or make it fail

`addupc()` is a stub ([besm6.S](besm6.S):773), so `profil(2)` is accepted, records nothing, and says
nothing. Its three callers ([clock.c](clock.c), [syscall.c](syscall.c), [trap.c](trap.c)) are all
guarded by `u.u_prof.pr_scale`, so today the stub is never reached with work to do.

**Decide the direction first.** Nothing in userland profiles: there is no `monitor()` or `mcount()`
in [../lib/libc/](../lib/libc/), `b6cc` has no `-p`, and no `prof(1)` is ported. So the cheap honest
move is to make `profil()` fail — `EINVAL` for a non-zero scale — and delete the stub, leaving one
line saying what would have to exist first. Implementing it is only worth doing behind a libc
`monitor()` and a host-side `prof`.

**If it is implemented:** v7's `addupc` indexes an array of 16-bit shorts by a byte offset, scaling
`pc` by a 16-bit binary fraction. Neither survives: the profile buffer here is an array of **words**,
and the bucket index is a word index, so `pr_scale`'s definition and `<sys/user.h>`'s `struct uprof`
have to be restated before any code is written. The update also lands in the *user's* buffer while
the kernel is unmapped, so it goes through `fuword`/`suword`, not a store — and it happens at clock
interrupt, so it must not fault.

**Size.** Small either way; the decision is the whole task.
